# Colton's Password Generator

## https://coltonto.github.io/PasswordGenerator/

## Hello there, thanks for checking out this repository! Below you will find details of this password generator.

- My motivation for this was to make a password generator that includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

- I built this password generator mostly because I think passwords are super important. Having a simple JavaScript application that generates passwords for you is a life saver! 

- What makes this password generator of mine stand out is how compact and simple the app is. 

## Installation 
-N/A

## Usage 
* A. Click on "Generate Password" to get started on your password. 
* B. Select a numeric value from 8-128 characters long.

* G. Congratulations! As long as you selected at least one value from steps C-F, you will have your brand new password!
