# Colton's Password Generator

## 

## Hello there, thanks for checking out this repository! Below you will find details of this password generator.

- My motivation for this was to make a password generator that includes uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

- I built this password generator mostly because I think passwords are super important. Having a simple JavaScript application that generates passwords for you is a life saver! 

- What makes this password generator of mine stand out is how compact and versatile it is. Without my messages, it's only 62 lines of code (not counting CSS and HTML)! Not only that, it can generate all kinds of passwords!
